# Admin Dashboard Improvements

## Overview

Made several improvements to the admin dashboard to enhance user experience and remove unnecessary sections as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed "Most Ordered Products" Section

- **Reason**: As per user request, this section was removed from the dashboard
- **Files Modified**: `lib/features/admin_dashboard/admin_dashboard.dart`
- **Impact**: Cleaner dashboard with reduced information overload

### 2. Removed "Need Approved" Label from Pending Orders Section

- **Reason**: As per user request, the "Needs Approval" label was removed from the recent pending orders section
- **Files Modified**: `lib/features/admin_dashboard/admin_dashboard.dart`
- **Impact**: Simplified UI with cleaner section headers

### 3. Cleaned Up Unused Code

- **Reason**: Removed unused functions that were related to the "Most Ordered Products" section
- **Functions Removed**:
  - `_buildPopularProductsSection`
  - `_buildPopularProductTile`
- **Impact**: Reduced codebase size and improved maintainability

### 4. Fixed Overflow Issues

- **Reason**: Ensured all text elements have proper overflow handling
- **Implementation**: Verified that existing `maxLines: 1` and `overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis` properties are in place
- **Sections Checked**:
  - Order headers
  - Customer information
  - Product names
  - Revenue displays

## Files Modified

     - Removed "Most Ordered Products" section from dashboard layout
     - Removed "Need Approved" label from pending orders section header
     - Removed unused functions related to popular products
     - Verified overflow handling on all text elements

## Benefits

2. **Focused Information**: Only the most essential information is displayed
3. **Better Performance**: Reduced code size and fewer widgets to render
