# Admin Product Form Improvements

## Overview

Modified the admin product add/edit form to improve the user experience by conditionally showing/hiding form fields based on the selected category.

## Changes Made

### 1. Conditional Offer Price Field

**File**: `lib/features/admin_dashboard/admin_dashboard.dart`
**Function**: `_ProductFormDialog.build`

**Changes**:

- Hide "Offer Price" field when "outdoor", "appliances", or "furniture" categories are selected
- Only show "Offer Price" field when "special" category is selected
- Renamed "Regular Price" label to "Price" when not in special category

### Implementation Details

#### Before:

- "Regular Price" and "Offer Price" fields were always visible regardless of category
- No clear distinction between regular products and special offers

#### After:

- For "outdoor", "appliances", "furniture" categories:
  - Only show "Price" field (single price field)
  - Hide "Offer Price" field
- For "special" category:
  - Show both "Regular Price" and "Offer Price" fields
  - Show additional "Discount %" field
  - Maintain existing "Rating" field

## Benefits

1. **Improved UX**: Form now adapts to the selected category, showing only relevant fields
2. **Reduced Clutter**: Non-special products don't need offer price fields
3. **Clearer Workflow**: Admins can easily distinguish between regular products and special offers
4. **Logical Grouping**: Related fields are grouped together based on product type
5. **Consistent with Business Logic**: Matches the actual data structure for different product types

## Files Modified

1. **Admin Dashboard Screen**
   - **File**: `lib/features/admin_dashboard/admin_dashboard.dart`
   - **Changes**: Modified the product form dialog to conditionally show/hide offer price field

## Testing Results

- ✅ Form correctly shows/hides offer price field based on category selection
- ✅ All form fields function properly
- ✅ Data is correctly saved to Firestore
- ✅ No validation errors with the new field logic
- ✅ GetX controllers functioning properly
- ✅ UI adapts correctly when switching between categories

## Implementation Code

The key change was modifying the price field section to use conditional rendering:

```dart
Obx(() => controller.selectedCategory.value == 'special'
    ? Row(
        children: [
          Expanded(
            child: _buildTextField(
              controller: controller.regularPriceController,
              label: 'Regular Price',
              icon: Icons.attach_money,
              keyboardType: TextInputType.number,
            ),
          ),
          SizedBox(width: 12),
          Expanded(
            child: _buildTextField(
              controller: controller.offerPriceController,
              label: 'Offer Price',
              icon: Icons.local_offer,
              keyboardType: TextInputType.number,
            ),
          ),
        ],
      )
    : _buildTextField(
        controller: controller.regularPriceController,
        label: 'Price',
        icon: Icons.attach_money,
        keyboardType: TextInputType.number,
      ))
```

## Future Considerations

1. **User Feedback**: Monitor if admins find the conditional fields intuitive
2. **Additional Categories**: Consider if other categories might need special field handling
3. **Form Validation**: May want to add specific validation for special offer fields
4. **Help Text**: Could add tooltips to explain why certain fields appear/disappear
